# ðŸ›’ Amazon Home Page Clone

This is my first web development project using HTML and CSS.  
Itâ€™s a simple static clone of the Amazon home page created to practice layout, styling, and page structure.  
No JavaScript or backend â€“ just front-end code for learning purposes.  
I used HTML for structure and CSS for styling.  
The page includes header, navbar, product sections, and footer.  
This helped me understand Flexbox, box model.
